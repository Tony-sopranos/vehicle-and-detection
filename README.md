# vehicle-and-detection
This code uses a pre-trained YOLOv4 model to perform real-time object detection using a webcam. It detects objects such as cars, motorcycles, bicycles, buses, trains, people, animals, and more. The results are displayed in real-time with bounding boxes and labels on the captured webcam feed.
